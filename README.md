## sorc-engine
A lightweight 3D model loader and viewer (WIP) built with OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM to explore the 3D rendering pipeline.

## Features

- 3D model loading with tinyobjloader
- Texture support via stb_image
- WASD + mouse camera system
- Shader-based rendering
- Basic rendering pipeline
- ImGui for debug UI

## Libraries

- glad
- GLFW
- glm
- assimp
- ImGui
- stb_image

## Learnings

- OpenGL shader programming and rendering pipeline
- Implemented camera controls and model loading
- Integrated ImGui for real-time debugging

## Planned Features

- Improved lighting (PBR, shadows)
- Texture optimization
- Model animation support

## Setup

- Inside Scripts folder:
  - Run Setup.bat to pull the premake5.exe and generate solution file.
- Open the generated solution file in your IDE.
- Build and run the project.
- Note: Work in progress, expect bugs. Feedback welcome!
