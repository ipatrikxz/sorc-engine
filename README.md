## sorc-engine
A lightweight 3D model loader and viewer (WIP) built with OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM to explore the 3D rendering pipeline.

## Features

3D model loading with tinyobjloader
Texture support via stb_image
WASD + mouse camera system
Shader-based rendering
Basic rendering pipeline
ImGui for debug UI

## Libraries

glad
GLFW
glm
tinyobjloader
ImGui
stb_image

## Learnings

Mastered OpenGL shader programming and rendering pipeline
Implemented camera controls and model loading
Integrated ImGui for real-time debugging

## Planned Features

Improved lighting (PBR, shadows)
Texture optimization
Model animation support

## Setup

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/ipatrikxz/sorc-engine
Install dependencies (GLFW, GLM, etc.)
Build with your preferred build system
Run and explore!

Note: Work in progress, expect bugs. Feedback welcome!
